        <h1>Odebamike David Ayomide</h1>
        <p>My name is Odebamike David Ayomide, hailing from Osun state. I am the second child of three. I recently graduated from the University of Lagos where I studied Medical Laboratory Science. I am currently interning at Military hospital in Lagos. I am also a student of Altschool Africa with student ID; ALT/SOE/024/0400.</p>

        <p>I joined Altschool Africa because of the multiple success stories I have heard from past students of this school. Knowing one of them personally, this motivated me to choose Altschool Africa as the school to pursue my tech dream. This plus the fact that I was satisfied with their schedule as it would enable me focus on my internship and at the same time, on my classes at Altschool.</p>

        <p>My goal for the school of Engineering programme is to learn as much as I possibly can so when I graduate from Altschool Africa, I will be ready to enter into the job market with complete confidence in my abilities as a Software Engineer.</p>
